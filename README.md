## Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### Required Terminologies 
#### Simulator
A Simulator is a tool for checking the RTL design which is designed according to the given specifications. In this workshop we used a open-source simulator called *iVerilog* for the design simulations. To know more about iVerilog, click

#### Design
The Verilog code created according with the given specification to meet certain functionalities is a *Design*.


#### Testbench
Testbench is a setup which applies stimulus to the design and match the output according to the given specifications. Testbench (*test_vectors*) essentially checks the function of the given design.
