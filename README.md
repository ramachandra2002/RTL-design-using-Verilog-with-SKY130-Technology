## Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis


### Simulator
A Simulator is a tool for checking the RTL design which is designed according to the given specifications. In this workshop we used a open-source simulator called *iVerilog* for the design simulations. To know more about iVerilog, click [here] (http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
