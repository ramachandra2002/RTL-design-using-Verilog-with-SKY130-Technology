# RTL-design-using-Verilog-with-SKY130-Technology
## Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

* In DAY 1  we learned about the usage of the simulator, iVerilog which is used for the simulation of the design of good multiplexer (good mux)
* iVerilog as a simulator and gtkwave as a waveform viewing tool for the .vcd file generated by the iVerilog
